# JavaScript Array Methods Evaluation Rubric

This rubric outlines the criteria for evaluating the **JavaScript :: Array methods** code challenge.

| Criterion                 | Not Achieved                                                             | Partially Achieved                                                        | Halfway Achieved                                                                       | Remarkably Achieved                                                               | Completely Achieved                                                                                    | Weighting |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Project Configuration** | Git, Node, test runner, or code formatter not initialized or configured. | Partial setup with issues in Git, Node, test runner, or code formatter.   | Setup mostly complete but with significant issues.                                     | Correct setup with minor issues in Git, Node, test runner, or code formatter.     | Fully initialized and configured Git, Node, test runner, and code formatter, meeting all requirements. | 10%       |
| **TDD**                   | No tests written or assertions implemented.                              | Basic or incomplete tests with insufficient assertions.                   | Tests partially implemented with coverage or assertion gaps.                           | Comprehensive tests and assertions with minor coverage issues.                    | Thorough test cases and assertions covering all scenarios, ensuring full coverage and validation.      | 50%       |
| **Compliance & JSDoc**    | Function does not meet requirements or lacks proper documentation.       | Function partially meets requirements or has incomplete/inaccurate JSDoc. | Function meets most requirements with minor issues in implementation or documentation. | Function correctly implements requirements and has clear JSDoc with minor errors. | Fully functional implementation with thorough, clear, and accurate JSDoc covering all aspects.         | 40%       |
