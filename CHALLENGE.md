# JavaScript :: Array methods

Welcome to the **JavaScript :: Array methods**! Your task is to implement, test, and document JavaScript functions as described below. This updated version includes essential project configuration steps and enhanced testing practices.

## Instructions

### Project Configuration

#### 1. Git & Node Setup

1. Initialize Git

2. Initialize Node Project

#### 2. Test Runner Configuration

1. Install Test Runner (`vitest`)

2. Define Test Script

#### 3. Code Formatters Configuration

1. Configure `.editorconfig`

### Code Testing

1. Test-Driven Development (TDD):

   - Write tests before implementing the function to ensure coverage.

2. Assertions:

   - Each function must include at least five test cases.

3. Run Tests:

   - Execute test script to validate your code. All tests must pass in üü¢ before submission.

### Code Completion

For each exercise:

1. Requirements Compliance:

   - Ensure the function implementation meets the requirements described in the task.

2. Documentation:

   - Use JSDoc notation to document each function.

## Workflow

### Branching Strategy

1. Work in `develop` branch:

   - Commit changes with descriptive messages, using convention commit notation (e.g., "feat: implement factorial function").

2. Create Pull Request (PR):

   - Submit a PR from `develop` to `main`.

3. Code review:

   - Await review, feedback or approval before merging.

## Submission Checklist

1. Functions implemented and documented using JSDoc.
2. All tests defined and passing.
3. Changes pushed to the `develop` branch.
4. Pull request created and submitted for review.

## AI Usage Guidelines

- Using AI is permitted. Make good use of it
- You may be asked to explain any code generated with AI.
- Failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for any block of code will result in the challenge being invalidated.
